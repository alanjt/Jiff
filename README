Jiff 

Originally written by Agostino de Marco to provide plots of JSBSim tables.
This version searches for tables within JSBSim functions, which would otherwise have been missed by the original program. 

Standard usage

Jiff is a command line program. A typical commands are

jiff -h
jiff myjsbsimfile.xml -g png

Each table must have a name e.g. 
			<table name =  "aero/table/nrTableM0.7">
				<independentVar lookup = "row">atmosphere/density-altitude</independentVar>
				<independentVar lookup = "column"> aero/alpha-deg </independentVar>
				<tableData>
					-6	0	6	12	18
					0	-0.5363	-0.5539	-0.5989	-0.6626	-0.7556
					10000	-0.5482	-0.5668	-0.6057	-0.6762	-0.7639
					30000	-0.5640	-0.5844	-0.6262	-0.6906	-0.7845
				</tableData>
			</table>
			
This will produce 3 jiff output files
aero_table_nrTableM0.7.dat,  aero_table_nrTableM0.7.plt, aero_table_nrTableM0.7.png 

the .dat file is the raw data in the table, the .plt file is for use by GNUPlot, and the .png is an image file.

GNUplot must be installed and the program should be in the environment path.

The present version does not support 3d tables.
